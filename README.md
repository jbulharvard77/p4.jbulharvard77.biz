====================

project 4

The function of the app is to allow people the ability to order their driveway be plowed on a specific basis rather than hiring a plower for a season.  After they sign up they simply need to choose a date for the service.

Plowers will also sign up to the app.  They can view all of the current pending requests and choose which one they want to accept.  This would be convenient for a plower. if they were on the road and checked their smart phone they could select a driveways that is close in proximity.

At this time I'm not thinking of this app in live practical terms.  My goal was to learn php and navigate through the framework, which I feel I have done.  I certainly focused more on the functionality than the style.

- The app will provide error messages if the input wasn't accepted


Javascipt
- The scripts on the driveway.js file compute the estimated cost for a driveway to be plowed based on input by the customer (/users/size).
- The jquery vaidate plugin is managing whether fields are filled out on the signup page (/users/signup). The jquery scripts are on the jqscripts.js file. 
- The jquery tablesorter plugin is controlling the appearanc eof the informaiton on the display screen (/posts/plowerdisplay).

Other
-You will need to log in as both a customer and then a plower to see the different aspects of the app.  They each have access to separate pages.
