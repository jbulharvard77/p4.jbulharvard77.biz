====================

project 4

The function of the app is to allow people the ability to schedule their driveway be plowed on a specific basis rather than hiring a plower for an entire season.  After they sign up they simply need to choose a date for the service.

Plowers will also sign up to the app.  They can view all of the current pending requests and choose which one they want to accept.  This would be convenient for a plower. for if they were on the road and checked their smart phone they could select a driveway that is close in proximity.

The style is clearly lacking.  The functionality dominated my time.


- The app will provide error messages if the input wasn't accepted
- It will not allow you to schedule on the same day that you previously scheduled for
- It will calculate the cost per the input from the customer


Javascript
- The scripts on the driveway.js file compute the estimated cost for a driveway to be plowed based on input by the customer (/users/size).
- The jquery vaidate plugin is managing whether fields are filled out on the signup page (/users/signup). The jquery scripts are on the jqscripts.js file. 
- The jquery tablesorter plugin is controlling the appearance of the information on the display screen (/posts/plowerdisplay).

Other
-You will need to log in as both a customer and then a plower to see the different aspects of the app.  They each have access to separate pages.
